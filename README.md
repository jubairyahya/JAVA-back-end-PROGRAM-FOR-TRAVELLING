TRAVEL SYSTEM 
I have developed a robust travel booking system in Java, encompassing classes for accommodations and transportation modes named Booking and Travel respectively, with the Plan class serving as the superclass for both. a user-friendly travel management system that provides hassle-free access to booking travel tickets and accommodations. This system aims to simplify the process for customers by offering easy navigation and clear pricing options.
